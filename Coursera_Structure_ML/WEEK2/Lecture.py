########## Module 1 ##########
##       Error Analysis     ##

#  Evaluate multiple ideas in parallel #
# Ideas for cat detection:
# - Fix pictures of dogs being recognized as catss
# - Fix great cats being misrecognized 
# - Improve performance on blurry images 

# Cleaning up incorrectly labeled data #
# Correcting incorrect dev/test set examples
# -Apply same process to your dev and test sets to make sure they continue to come from the same distribution 
# -Consider examining examples your algorithm got right as wekk as ones it got wrong 
# -Train and dev/test data may now come from slightly different distributions

# Build your system quickly, the iterate #
# Speech recognition example
# -Noisy background 
# -Accented speech 
# -Far from micphone
# -Stuttering


# Steps 
# 1. Set up dev/test set and metric 
# 2. Build initial system quickly 
# 3. Use Bias/Variance analysis & Error analysis to prioritize next stops
